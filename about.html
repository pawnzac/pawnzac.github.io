  <h2>About me</h2>



  <p>I write science-fiction flavored fantasy. I have been writing fiction for the past four years or so, and I'm about to start putting it out there. I'd dig it if you'd check out <a href="the_ghost_in_the_heart_of_tarven.html">my novella</a>!</p>
  
  <p>In real life, I am a statistics person in the tech industry. I'm an American, originally from Southern California.  Now, I live in the Midwest with chipmunks, skunks, rabbits, and squirrels. Occasionally, raccoons invade our territory as well.</p>

  <p>I like history and especially old myths and religions. I'm not really religious myself, but I find the idea of Gods fascinating and how belief intersects with history. So a lot of my writing is about the Gods and religious wars... in space.</p>

  <p>I started writing because I had this idea for a fantasy world with a religious conflict. Initially, because I program, I thought I'd write a computer role-playing game.  I wrote a basic engine, game rules, and a few levels, but I realized I was having more fun writing the story than the game so I decided to ditch the pretense and just write a novel with the world I'd started building (which had gotten seriously out of hand). I started writing drafts of what would become my current project in 2021 and wrote and threw out multiple 100k's words until I started to figure it out.</p>

  <p>The most embarassing thing about myself that I am willing to share with Strangers On The Internet: I am an enormous (unhealthy) fan of Lana Del Rey. We are not yet good enough friends, dear Stranger, that I can reveal to you what percentile I am in the Spotify listening distribution for Lana, but one day, I hope we will be.</p>
