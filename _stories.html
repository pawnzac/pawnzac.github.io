        <p>Ludeng Corporation has done the improbable. They have developed a device, inserted just below the heart, that makes people live three times longer.</p>

        <p>But the Heart is more miracle than scientific breakthrough. The source of its power and the mechanism by which it operates are a mystery.  Not even the brightest minds in the Shilloan Empire have been able to reverse engineer the technology.</p>

        <p><b>What makes the Heart of Tarven beat?</b></p>

        <p>That is the question that drives Dian Corporation to send a failed scientist and disappointing son of privilege, Birik Lev, to infiltrate Ludeng in a desparate attempt to rescue their falling stock price.</p>

        <p>His only source inside Ludeng: a fellow new employee Adiri Roni, a failed entrepreneur falling back on a corporate career, who knows more than she appears to.</p>
        
        <p>Birik learns Ludeng's labs hold more than machinery and test tubes.</p>

        <p>He finds lies, love, consequences, and an old power all but forgotten.</p>

According to every other department, the name notes the similarity between the roles of the junior scientists who work there and livestock.</i></p>
  
  <p>On Religion: <i>“If Man wants to play God, He should be Godly. He should take on the Gods’ burden, not just Their power…”</i></p>

  <p>On Corporate Productivity: <i>"Bitching is part of my process."</i></p>

  <p>On Science: <i>“He has tenure. I have deadlines.”</i></p>

      convincing evidence I have ever heard that the Gods exist and that They
      love me.</i></p>
  
  <p>On Interplanetary Relations: <i> “Well, that answers one question I’ve had about
      Tarvenians but have been too afraid to ask: it <em>is</em> green...”</i></p>
