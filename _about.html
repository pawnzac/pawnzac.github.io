  <h2>About me</h2>



  <p>I write science-fiction flavored fantasy. I'd dig it if you'd check out <a href="the_ghost_in_the_heart_of_tarven.html">my novella</a>!</p>
  
  <p>In real life, I am a statistics person in the tech industry. I'm an American, originally from Southern California.  Now, I live in the Midwest with chipmunks, skunks, rabbits, and squirrels. Occasionally, raccoons invade our territory as well.</p>

  <p>About four years ago, I started writing this fantasy world set in space with a story focused around a religious war. Initially, because I program, I thought I'd write a computer role-playing game.  I wrote a basic engine, game rules, and a few levels, but I realized I was having more fun writing the story than the game so I decided to ditch the pretense and just write a novel with the world I'd started building (which had gotten seriously out of hand). I started writing drafts of what would become my current project in 2021 and wrote and threw out hundreds of pages until I started to figure it out. The <a href="plans.html">plan</a> is to make this an anthology series.</p>

  <p>The most embarassing thing about myself that I am willing to share with Strangers On The Internet: I am an enormous (unhealthy) fan of Lana Del Rey. We are not yet good enough friends, dear Stranger, that I can reveal to you what percentile I am in the Spotify listening distribution for Lana, but one day, I hope we will be.</p>
