        <p><u>From Dust</u> is a story about how technology changes us and the search for something old to hold onto when all is in flux. It’s also a story about love and baseball.</p>

        <p>Technology has made humanity immortal, so we no longer wonder what will happen when we die. Religion's sales pitch no longer resonates, but Diego Lopez, a Preacher, still keeps up the weekly church service, despite the lack of parishioners. His great curse: he buys his own Book. He truly believes it, but even the Preacher doubts the utility of his faith. What does God matter in a world without Death, when Eternity is not in the world to come, but in the here and now?</p>

        <p>The Sluggers, the local baseball team from Sama, Mars, are terrible, but Diego's a fan. He spends his nights drinking and watching the games with the bar’s owner, Melissa, who tries to convince him to give up preaching. She tells him the bar’s in a bad spot with the Sluggers so far out of contention: 40 games below even at the All-Star break. If the team could just get back in the race, she’d have the money to keep the place open. Diego prays for a miracle and for a chance to show that faith still matters in a world without Death.</p>
